# learn-go

Documenting my knowledge as I learn Golang through a two-part Free Code Camp (FCC) Course with the following contents:

## /tutorials ##
This folder consists of the basics of Golang which I learned from a 7-hour FCC course comprised of 15 sections. For each of these sections I annotated code, and summarized its main ideas.

## /web-server ##
In this project, I built a web server capable of handling three routes illustrated through the following diagram (credit: Free Code Camp)

## /crud-api
In this project, I built a CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) API based on the following diagram (credit: Free Code Camp)

The API was tested using Postman and handles five routes as shown in the diagram above with gorilla/mux which is a HTTP router and URL matcher for building Go web servers.

I will continue to update this repository as I learn Golang more extensively!
